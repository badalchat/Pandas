# Pandas Introduction

* Pandas is an open source data analysis library written in Python.
* It leverages the power and speed of numpy to make data analysis and preprocessing easy for data scientists.
* It provides rich and highly robust data operations.


## Pandas has two types of data structures:

1. Series - it's one dimension array with indexes, it stores a single column or row of dataframe

2. DataFrame - it's a tabular spreadsheet like structure representing rows each of which contains one or multiple columns

 ```A one-dimensional array(labeled) capable of holding any type of data- Series```
 ```A two-dimensionl data(labeled) structure with columns of potentially different types of data- DataFrame```
